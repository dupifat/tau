# Features

A guide to the major features of (dpc's) Tau coding agent. For high-level
philosophy and motivation see [README.md](README.md); for design notes see
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).


## Architecture

### Process-oriented components

Every major component — UI, harness, LLM provider, extensions — runs as a
standalone POSIX process and talks CBOR-encoded events over stdio (extensions)
or a Unix socket (UI ↔ harness). A component is just an executable: supervise
it with your init system, sandbox it with bubblewrap or Landlock, swap it for
anything else that speaks the protocol, or write a new one in any language.

The default `tau` binary bundles all first-party components and dispatches via
hidden `tau ext <name>` subcommands; you can replace any of them by editing
`harness.json5`.

### Persisted event log

Every protocol event in a session is appended to
`<state_dir>/<session_id>/events.cbor` (length-prefixed CBOR stream). The
in-memory [`SessionTree`] is rebuilt from the log on resume, so the on-disk
record and the live view cannot drift. Because the log is a stream of typed
events rather than a flat transcript, sessions branch into a tree: rewinding
to an earlier turn keeps the abandoned branch on disk.

```
$ tau session-list
$ tau session-show --session-id <id>
$ tau run -r              # resume the latest session for this cwd
$ tau run -r <id>         # resume a specific one
```

Inside the UI, `/tree` prints the branch graph and `/tree <node-id>` rewinds
the head to that node.

### Interception system

Components can register as event interceptors with priority + selector pairs;
matching events are routed through the interceptor and only reach the bus and
event log if it allows them. Exact selectors win over prefix matches; ties are
broken by component name. This is how things like the policy gate or the
delegate progress tracker plug in without modifying the harness core.

See [`docs/interceptors.md`](docs/interceptors.md) and
`crates/tau-harness/src/interception.rs`.

### Remote extensions over SSH

Because extensions are stdio child processes, running one on another machine
is a matter of prefixing its argv with an `ssh` invocation:

```json5
// harness.json5
extensions: {
  "core-shell": {
    prefix: ["ssh", "user@host"],
  },
},
```

The harness prepends `prefix` to the resolved command. Anything that gives you
a stdio pipe to a remote process works the same way (`docker exec`, `nsenter`,
`bwrap`, …).

### Reasoning effort

Tau exposes a uniform six-level effort knob — `off`, `minimal`, `low`,
`medium`, `high`, `xhigh` — that maps onto provider-specific reasoning
controls. Defaults can be set per-model:

```json5
// harness.json5
default_efforts: {
  "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7": "high",
},
```

In the UI: `/effort medium`, or hit `Shift+Tab` to cycle.

### Prompt input caching

For providers that support it, Tau emits stable `prompt_cache_key` routing
keys (derived from base URL, model id, and session cwd) so cache hits survive
restarts and parallel sessions, and sets `prompt_cache_retention` where
available. Provider compatibility flags live next to the model entry
(`supports_prompt_cache_key`, `supports_prompt_cache_retention`). Toggle the
status-bar hit-rate readout with `/show-cache-stats`.

### Policy / approvals

Subscription approvals are persisted to `<state_dir>/policy.cbor` so that
trusted client/selector pairs don't re-prompt on every reconnect. View them
with `tau policy-show`.


## Built-in extensions

Every built-in extension is a regular extension under
`crates/tau-ext-*/`. Each is configured under `extensions.<name>` in
`harness.json5` and can be disabled with `enable: false`, swapped via
`command:` / `prefix:`, or given free-form `config:` payload that arrives at
startup as a `LifecycleConfigure` message.

```json5
extensions: {
  "core-shell":         { enable: false },               // disable
  "core-agent":         { prefix: ["ssh", "user@host"] },// run remotely
  "core-notifications": { config: { idle_seconds: 30 } },// reconfigure
},
```

### `core-shell` — shell and filesystem tools

Registers the everyday tools the agent uses to inspect and edit a project:
`shell`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, plus an `echo` tool
for testing. The shell command and any wrapper prefix are configurable:

```json5
"core-shell": {
  config: {
    shell: { command: "bash", prefix: ["nix", "develop", "-c"] },
  },
},
```

### `core-agent` — LLM backend

The conversation driver: assembles prompts, streams provider responses, drives
tool invocations, emits reasoning blocks, and respects the effort knob. Talks
to OpenAI-compatible Responses-API and Chat-Completions-API providers; manage
credentials with `tau provider add` / `tau provider login`.

### `core-notifications` — idle and turn notifications

Plays a sound on prompt submit and on the final response of a turn. After
`idle_seconds` of inactivity following a final response (default 60s) it asks
the agent for a one-sentence summary and emits a desktop notification — useful
when a long task finishes while you're in another window.

### `core-delegate` — sub-task delegation

Exposes a `delegate` tool that spawns a side conversation off the current
node, runs to completion against the same model and tool set, and returns its
result to the caller. Recursion is allowed. Live progress (turns, current
tool) is shown in the parent UI alongside the delegate's task name.

### `websearch-exa` — opt-in web search

Proxies a single `websearch_exa` tool to Exa's hosted `web_search_exa` MCP
endpoint. Off by default; enable in `harness.json5` and supply an API key via
config.


## CLI / UI

Tau ships a terminal UI that aims for *every pixel of estate is content* —
fast startup, no chrome.

### Slash commands

Type `/` for menu autocompletion. The built-in set:

| Command             | Effect                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/quit`             | Exit the session                                     |
| `/detach`           | Leave the UI, keep the harness running for reattach  |
| `/new`              | Start a fresh session in this harness                |
| `/model <id>`       | Switch model (Tab completes from provider list)      |
| `/effort <level>`   | Set reasoning effort (`Shift+Tab` cycles)            |
| `/tree [id]`        | Print session tree; with `id`, rewind head           |
| `/show-diff`        | Toggle expanded diffs vs. compact `+N/-M` chip       |
| `/show-thinking`    | Toggle agent reasoning summaries                     |
| `/show-cache-stats` | Toggle prompt-cache hit stats in the status bar      |

Toggle state is persisted to `<state_dir>/cli.json`.

### Path autocompletion

When the prompt buffer starts with `./` or `../`, Tab triggers filesystem path
completion against the current working directory — handy for naming files in
free-form prompts. Slash-command arguments use the same menu but are populated
dynamically by the harness (model list, effort levels, …).

### Customizable key bindings

`cli.json5` exposes a `bind:` table that maps key chords to prompt-local
shell actions. Bindings are layered on top of built-ins; user entries with the
same key replace the built-in binding.

Supported actions:

- `shell-prompt-edit`: dump the prompt to `$TAU_PROMPT_PATH`, run the shell
  command, then replace the prompt with the file contents on success.
- `shell-prompt-insert`: run the shell command and insert its stdout at the
  cursor on success.

Command environment:

- `TAU_PROMPT_PATH`: tempfile containing the current prompt.
- `TAU_PROMPT_ROW` / `TAU_PROMPT_COLUMN`: 1-indexed cursor position for
  editor commands that support `file:row:column` syntax. Multi-line row
  calculation is still limited.

Default bindings:

```json5
bind: {
  "C-f": {
    action: "shell-prompt-insert",
    command: "rg --files --hidden --glob '!.git' | fzf",
    trim: true,
  },
  "C-o": {
    action: "shell-prompt-edit",
    command: "${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-}} \"$TAU_PROMPT_PATH\"",
  },
  "C-g": {
    action: "shell-prompt-edit",
    command: "${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-}} \"$TAU_PROMPT_PATH\"",
  },
},
```

A Helix override:

```json5
bind: {
  "C-o": {
    action: "shell-prompt-edit",
    command: 'hx "$TAU_PROMPT_PATH:$TAU_PROMPT_ROW:$TAU_PROMPT_COLUMN"',
  },
  "C-g": {
    action: "shell-prompt-edit",
    command: 'hx "$TAU_PROMPT_PATH:$TAU_PROMPT_ROW:$TAU_PROMPT_COLUMN"',
  },
},
```

Use `trim: true` for commands like `fzf` whose selected value ends with a
newline you do not want inserted into the prompt.

### `Ctrl+O` — edit prompt in your editor

The default `C-o` binding suspends the UI, opens the prompt in `$EDITOR`, and
replaces the buffer with whatever you save. Redraws are paused while the
editor owns the terminal.

### `Ctrl+F` — fzf (or anything else) into the prompt

Because bindings are arbitrary shell commands, wiring fzf or another picker
into the prompt is straightforward:

```json5
bind: {
  "C-f": {
    action: "shell-prompt-insert",
    command: "rg --files --hidden --glob '!.git' | fzf",
    trim: true,
  },
  "C-r": {
    action: "shell-prompt-insert",
    command: "rg --files | fzf --query=\"$(cat $TAU_PROMPT_PATH)\"",
    trim: true,
  },
},
```

Replace `rg --files | fzf` with `git ls-files | fzf`, a custom script, or
whatever fits your workflow.

### Thinking / reasoning rendering

When the model emits reasoning blocks, the UI renders them inline above the
final answer, styled distinctly from the response. `/show-thinking` toggles
visibility globally; past blocks re-render in place when the toggle flips, so
you can hide them after the fact. Reasoning blocks are not replayed back to
the provider as input — they remain provider-side context.

### Diff rendering

File mutations made by `write` and `edit` render as inline diffs. By default
they collapse to a compact `+N/-M` chip; `/show-diff` expands them to the
full unified hunk view. The terminal renderer uses cell-level differential
updates to avoid full repaints on each token.

### Theming

The UI ships with a built-in Solarized-derived "tau" theme. Themes map
semantic style names (`prompt.marker`, `banner.accent`, `system.info`, diff
hunks, reasoning blocks, …) to terminal attributes; user themes can be
loaded from a JSON5 file. See `crates/tau-themes/themes/tau.json5` for the
full style key list.

### Session resume and detach

`/detach` leaves the harness daemon running so the agent can keep working in
the background; `tau run --attach` reconnects later. `tau run -r` resumes the
most recent session for the current `cwd`, `tau run -r <id>` picks a specific
one. The session tree, including abandoned branches, is preserved across
restarts.
