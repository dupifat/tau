//! A coalescing notify channel with multiple senders and a single receiver.
//!
//! The shared state is conceptually a single `bool`. Senders set it to `true`;
//! the receiver blocks until it becomes `true`, then atomically resets it to
//! `false`. Multiple sends before a receive coalesce into one notification.
//!
//! When every `Sender` has been dropped the channel becomes *disconnected*.
//! A pending notification always takes priority over disconnection: the
//! receiver will see `Ok(())` first and only get `Err(Disconnected)` on the
//! next call.
