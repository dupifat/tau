//! User-tweakable UI settings exposed through `/set <name> <value>`.
//!
//! Each [`SettingDef`] knows how to read/write a field on [`CliState`]
//! and what its allowed values are. The registry drives both the
//! `/set` parser and completion (setting names with current values,
//! then values with descriptions).
//!
//! All settings are currently booleans rendered as `true`/`false`,
//! but the shape is value-list based so a future setting can take
//! three or more named values without further plumbing.
