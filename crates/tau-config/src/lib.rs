//! Settings live in `~/.config/tau/` as JSON5: `cli.yaml` and
//! `harness.yaml`, each with an optional `*.d/*.yaml` drop-in directory
//! for layered overrides. See
//! [`settings`] for the schema and loader entry points.
//!
//! Resolved-harness types and the user-vs-builtin extension resolver
//! live in `tau-harness` — this crate just owns the on-disk schema.
