//! Structured diff payload returned by file-mutation tools.
//!
//! Tools that change file contents attach a [`DiffSummary`] to their result so
//! UIs can render it however they
//! like — themed colors, expand/collapse, intra-line highlighting,
//! jump-to-changed-line — instead of being handed a pre-formatted
//! string.
//!
//! On the wire this rides as a CBOR sub-tree under the tool result's
//! `diff` field. Encode/decode go through serde so the schema stays
//! single-sourced.
