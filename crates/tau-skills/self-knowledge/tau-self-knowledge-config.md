# Tau configuration

Tau follows the XDG directory layout on Linux:

- Config: `~/.config/tau/`
  - `cli.yaml`, `cli.d/*.yaml` — CLI display preferences, key bindings, and prompt completions. See `tau-self-knowledge-cli-ui` for UI-specific behavior.
  - `harness.yaml`, `harness.d/*.yaml` — harness roles/defaults, extensions, tools, custom prompts, and session retention.
- State: `~/.local/state/tau/` or the platform/user state directory.
  - `sessions/<session_id>/` — durable session membership, metadata, logs, and debug captures.
  - `agents/<agent_id>/` — durable agent transcripts and metadata.
  - `cli.json` — persisted CLI runtime toggles.
  - `policy.cbor` — persisted socket-client policy decisions.
  - `auth.d/<provider>.json` — provider credentials; `auth.json` may exist as legacy credentials.
- Runtime: `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/tau/<pid>/` or `/tmp/tau-$USER/<pid>/`.
  - `tau.sock`, `tau.pid`, `tau.session_id`, `tau.dir` — daemon socket and discovery markers.

Use `tau init` to create starter `cli.yaml` and `harness.yaml` files.

## Built-in defaults

Tau layers these defaults underneath user config and `*.d/*.yaml` drop-ins.

### Harness defaults

```yaml
{harness_config}
```

### CLI UI defaults

```yaml
{ui_config}
```

## Agent IDs and display names

Tau mints durable agent IDs from the harness setting `agents.id_template`. Tau can also name newly created agents with optional `agents.display_name_template`:

```yaml
agents:
  id_template: "{{{{role_group}}}}-{{{{random_alphanumeric 4}}}}"
  display_name_template: "{{{{role_group}}}}: {{{{task_name}}}}"
```

The built-in ID template is `{{{{random_alphanumeric 6}}}}`; the built-in display-name template is `{{{{#if task_name_present}}}}{{{{role}}}}: {{{{task_name}}}}{{{{else}}}}{{{{role}}}}{{{{/if}}}}`. Both template types are rendered with Handlebars in strict mode.

ID templates receive:

- `role` — the role name for the new agent.
- `role_group` — the name of the first configured role group containing the role, or the role name for ungrouped roles. `roleGroup` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `random_alphanumeric <len>` — helper that emits an ASCII alphanumeric random suffix of at least `<len>` characters.

Display-name templates additionally receive:

- `agent_id` — the durable agent ID. `agentId` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `task_name` — the requested task/display name for delegated or extension-started agents, or `""` when absent. `taskName` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `task_name_present` — true when `task_name` is available. `taskNamePresent` is also available as a camelCase alias.
Rendered IDs must use only ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-`, and must fit Tau's agent ID length limit. If a configured ID template fails to render, renders an invalid ID, or keeps colliding, Tau warns and falls back to the built-in random template. If a configured display-name template fails to render or renders empty, Tau warns when appropriate and falls back to the request display name when one exists.

## Providers

Use `tau provider add` for the interactive provider setup wizard. It prompts for provider kind, provider namespace, auth, and model details as needed.

Other provider commands:

- `tau provider list` — show configured provider profiles.
- `tau provider remove <name>` — remove a provider profile.

Models are published by provider extensions at runtime; start Tau and use `/model` to inspect the current model list.

- `harness.yaml` can define `custom_prompts` as a map from prompt id to prompt text; in the CLI, `/prompt <id>` replaces the editable prompt buffer with that text without submitting it.
