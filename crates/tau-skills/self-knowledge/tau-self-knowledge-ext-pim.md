# Tau std-pim extension self-knowledge

`std-pim` is Tau's built-in personal information management extension. It runs `tau-ext-pim`, registers the model-visible `email` and `calendar` tools, and publishes `/email` and `/calendar` user actions.

The legacy `std-email` built-in alias remains for old email-only configs. Prefer `std-pim` for new configs, especially when calendar support is needed. Do not enable both `std-pim` and `std-email` for the same account set.

Use this skill when helping a user configure PIM. Do not include personal addresses, server names, passwords, tokens, calendar URLs, event details, or message contents unless the user explicitly provided them for that answer.


## Capabilities

Email:

- list accounts and folders
- list recent messages or UID-ordered pages
- read full mail only when policy or exact user approval allows it
- send, trash, star/unstar, mark read/unread
- queue unsafe incoming reads and outgoing sends for `/email` approval actions
- append sanitized audit logs under the extension state directory

Calendar:

- list accounts and calendars
- list bounded event rows and free/busy rows with cursor pagination
- read one event by id
- read-only ICS feed accounts for standard `.ics` calendars
- Google Calendar native API reads and user-approved writes: create, update, delete, and RSVP
- Google OAuth device authorization via `/calendar auth google start <account>` and `/calendar auth google finish <account>`
- append sanitized calendar audit logs and queue writes for `/calendar change` approval by default


## Config shape

`std-pim` nests module config under `config.email` and `config.calendar`.

```yaml
{pim_config}
```

Important migration from old email-only config:

- Rename `extensions.std-email` to `extensions.std-pim`.
- Move old email fields from `extensions.std-email.config.*` to `extensions.std-pim.config.email.*`.
- Put calendar config under `extensions.std-pim.config.calendar.*`.
- Keep secret declarations under `extensions.std-pim.secrets`.
- Add `calendar` to any role's `enableTools` list when the role should use calendars.


## Secrets

Declare secret names under `extensions.std-pim.secrets`, then provide the values as Tau secrets. Secret files are trimmed UTF-8 text despite the `.yaml` suffix.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/state/tau/secrets
printf '%s\n' 'mail-password-or-app-token' > ~/.local/state/tau/secrets/mail_password.yaml
printf '%s\n' 'https://example.com/private.ics' > ~/.local/state/tau/secrets/personal_calendar_ics_url.yaml
printf '%s\n' 'google-oauth-client-id' > ~/.local/state/tau/secrets/google_calendar_client_id.yaml
printf '%s\n' 'google-oauth-client-secret' > ~/.local/state/tau/secrets/google_calendar_client_secret.yaml
chmod 600 ~/.local/state/tau/secrets/*.yaml
```

Or for one startup, use `TAU_SECRET_<NAME>`, for example `TAU_SECRET_MAIL_PASSWORD=... tau`. Do not put passwords, refresh tokens, app passwords, or private ICS URLs directly in `harness.yaml`.


## Google Calendar authorization

For new Google Calendar configs, omit `refresh_token_secret` and use the device flow. Create a Google OAuth client of type `TVs and Limited Input devices`; desktop, web, Android, and iOS client IDs fail the device authorization start request with `invalid_client: Invalid client type`. Google may show both a client id and client secret for that client type. Configure both `client_id_secret` and `client_secret_secret`; the start request uses the client id, and the finish/token exchange can use the client secret. The device flow requests the full Google Calendar scope because Google's device endpoint rejects some narrower Calendar scopes such as `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`.

1. Start Tau with the `std-pim` config and the Google client id and client secret present.
2. Run `/calendar auth google start <account>`.
3. Open the printed URL manually and enter the printed user code.
4. Run `/calendar auth google finish <account>`.

The extension stores the returned refresh token in private calendar state. The action output never includes the refresh token. Action events are transient by default, and only the short-lived user code and URL are shown.

Manual refresh tokens still work for power users by setting `refresh_token_secret` on the Google backend and declaring/providing that secret. If `refresh_token_secret` is set, `/calendar auth google` refuses to overwrite it; remove the field first to use state-owned OAuth.

Google access tokens are short-lived and cached in memory until near expiry. Restarting Tau drops the access-token cache but keeps the refresh token.


## Calendar policies and output safety

Recommended defaults:

- `calendar.policy.read.private_events: busy_only`
- `calendar.policy.read.descriptions: approved_only`
- `calendar.policy.write.require_approval: true`
- keep `calendar.accounts[*].calendars.allow` narrow

Calendar tool results use the same `ok`, `command`, `status`, `data` envelope convention as email. Line arrays include `data.format`; paginated event commands include `data.next_cursor` and `data.truncated`. `list_events` and `free_busy` are bounded reads; if `start` is omitted they default to midnight 2 days before the current date, and if `end` is omitted it defaults to 7 days after `start`. Read results include effective `data.start`/`data.end`; reuse those while paginating.

Calendar writes should normally return `approval_required`; then the agent should wait for the user to inspect and approve with `/calendar change list`, `/calendar change open <id>`, and `/calendar change approve <id>`. Existing Google event writes use internally cached ETags; if the event changed, the agent should re-read it and retry.


## Email policies and output safety

Recommended defaults:

- keep `email.policy.incoming_auth.require: true`
- configure exact `email.policy.incoming_auth.trusted_authserv_ids`
- keep `email.policy.incoming_auth.allow_dmarc_only: false` unless the user explicitly accepts the weaker policy
- keep `incoming_allow`, `outgoing_allow`, and `folders.allow` narrow

Incoming email body reads are fail-closed. If policy does not allow full access, the model should use `email.request_full`, then wait for `/email in open <id>` and `/email in approve <id>`. Outgoing sends that violate recipient policy queue under `/email out` actions.


## Troubleshooting

If PIM tools are unavailable:

- Check `extensions.std-pim.enable: true`.
- Check module enables: `config.email.enable: true` and/or `config.calendar.enable: true`.
- Check the role has `enableTools: [email, calendar]` or equivalent.
- Check startup config errors for missing required secrets.

If Google Calendar says the account is not authorized, run `/calendar auth google start <account>` and `/calendar auth google finish <account>`. If start returns `invalid_client: Invalid client type`, replace the client id with one from a Google OAuth client of type `TVs and Limited Input devices`. If it still fails, confirm the Google OAuth client is valid and has Calendar API access/scopes.

If ICS calendar reads fail, verify the private ICS URL secret is present and reachable from the Tau process.

For tracing logs, use:

```sh
TAU_EXT_LOG=pim=debug tau
```
