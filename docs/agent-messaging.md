# Agent messaging tool

The harness-owned `message` tool lets an agent send an asynchronous short text note to the user or to another agent. Every successful send is recorded as an `agent.message_sent` sender projection; agent recipients also get a separate `agent.message_received` recipient projection with the same `message_id`. User-recipient messages always render fully; agent-to-agent UI display depends on `/set show-messages`. When shown fully, a message renders as:

```text
Message from <sender> to <recipient>:
<message>
```

`/set show-messages` modes are:

User-recipient messages are human-visible broadcasts: they always render fully in every attached UI's currently visible transcript, regardless of `/set show-messages`. Agent-to-agent message projections still obey `/set show-messages`:

- `none`: no UI indication or history of agent-to-agent messages
- `self-summary`: no UI indication for agent-to-agent messages
- `self-full`: no UI indication for agent-to-agent messages
- `all-summary`: one-line no-content indication for agent-to-agent messages
- `all-full`: full content of all messages

## Send to the user

Use the special recipient id `user`:

```text
message({"recipient_id":"user","message":"I found the root cause and am checking the fix now."})
```

On success the tool result is:

```text
Message sent
```

## Send to another agent

Start the other agent with `agent_start`. The child starts with fresh transcript context, but inheritable per-agent metadata such as shell cwd is copied from the parent. The instant background placeholder includes `self_agent_id` and `sub_agent_id` headers. The final `agent_start` result carries the same ids, while the sub-agent's response text arrives through the `agent_watch` async response-notification path:

```text
tau_internal: true
self_agent_id: senior-engineer_a
sub_agent_id: engineer_b

Tool call `call_123` is running in the background.
```

Use `sub_agent_id` as `recipient_id`:

```text
message({"recipient_id":"engineer_b","message":"Please also inspect crates/tau-cli/src/event_renderer.rs."})
```

The UI may display, summarize, or hide agent-to-agent messages depending on `/set show-messages`. The recipient agent also receives a hidden internal prompt with the message body XML-escaped inside a `<message>` wrapper.

## Watch another agent's responses

Use `agent_watch` to enable or disable hidden async notifications when another
agent produces a response:

```text
agent_watch({"agent_id":"engineer_b","enable":true})
```

`agent_start` automatically enables watching for the sub-agent it creates. A watch notification is delivered to the watching agent as a hidden internal prompt that is distinct from an explicit `message` tool delivery:

```text
[tau-internal]: Agent engineer_b finished its turn

<response>
Task result text.
</response>
```

The `agent_start` tool result only confirms metadata such as `self_agent_id` and `sub_agent_id`; response text arrives through watch notifications. Disable watching explicitly when later responses are no longer wanted.

Disable watching with:

```text
agent_watch({"agent_id":"engineer_b","enable":false})
```

## Invalid recipients and arguments

A non-`user` recipient must be a live or pending `agent_id`. Otherwise the tool fails and no `agent.message_sent` or `agent.message_received` projection is emitted.

If the id was never known, the tool reports an unknown recipient:

```text
message({"recipient_id":"engineer_0","message":"hello"})
```

```text
unknown message recipient: `engineer_0`
```

If the id belonged to an agent that has already finished or was canceled before it could start, the tool reports a stopped recipient:

```text
message({"recipient_id":"engineer_1","message":"hello"})
```

```text
stopped message recipient: `engineer_1`
```

Tool arguments are schema-validated before dispatch. Unknown extra fields are rejected before any logical tool invocation is logged.
